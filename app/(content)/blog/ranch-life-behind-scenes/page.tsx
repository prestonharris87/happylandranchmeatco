              People often ask what a typical day looks like on a working ranch. The truth is, 
              no two days are exactly the same‚Äîweather, seasons, and the needs of our animals 
              dictate the rhythm of ranch life. But there are constants: early mornings, 
              honest work, and the deep satisfaction that comes from caring for the land and animals.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              My day starts before 5:30 AM, often while it's still dark. There's something 
              peaceful about those quiet moments before the world wakes up‚Äîjust me, a cup of 
              coffee, and the anticipation of what the day will bring. The first priority is 
              always checking on our animals.

              mothers multiple times throughout the day and night.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Ranch life is full of surprises. Just last week, we had a cow go into labor during 
              a thunderstorm. There's nothing quite like helping bring new life into the world 
              while lightning flashes overhead and rain soaks through your jacket. But when that 
              calf took its first breath and stood up on wobbly legs, every uncomfortable moment 
              was worth it.
            </p>

            <div className="relative aspect-video mb-8 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
              <Image
                src={placeholderImage('Newborn calf with mother in green pasture', 800, 450).src}

              />
            </div>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Then there are the equipment breakdowns that always seem to happen at the worst 
              possible moment, the escaped cattle that decide the neighbor's corn field looks 
              more appealing than their own pasture, and the wildlife encounters that remind 
              you that you're sharing this land with creatures who were here long before you.
            </p>

            <h2 className="heading-3 text-brand-forest mb-6">Why We Do It</h2>
            
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Ranch work is physically demanding, mentally challenging, and never really ends. 
              So why do we choose this life? It's because every day, we're part of something 
              bigger than ourselves. We're stewards of the land, caretakers of animals, and 
              providers of food for families.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              There's deep satisfaction in watching a pasture recover from overgrazing, in 
              seeing a sick animal return to health, in knowing that the beef we produce is 
              raised with integrity and care. It's about being connected to the land and the 
              cycles of nature in a way that few people experience anymore.
            </p>

            <h2 className="heading-3 text-brand-forest mb-6">The Reward</h2>
            
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              At the end of a long day, when the sun is setting over the oak savanna and the 
              cattle are settled for the night, there's a moment of perfect peace. The work 
              is hard, but it's honest work. The hours are long, but they're spent in one 
              of the most beautiful places on earth.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
              And when customers tell us they can taste the difference in our beef, when they 
              say it's the best they've ever had, we know that every early morning, every 
              late night, and every challenging day has been worth it. Because we're not just 
              raising cattle‚Äîwe're raising the bar for what beef should be.
